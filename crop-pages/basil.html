      Summary
      <p id="summary">
        Basil is a fragrant herb from the mint family, 
        commonly used in cookingâ€”especially Italian and
        Southeast Asian dishes. It thrives in warm weather,
        needs full sun, and prefers well-drained, fertile 
        soil. Basil grows quickly and can be harvested by 
        pinching off leaves regularly to encourage bushy 
        growth. Prevent it from flowering to keep the 
        flavor strong. It's ideal for backyard gardens,
        containers, and windowsills.
